# odin-recipes

This project required me to code a multi-page website using HTML. Though the website was extremely basic, I was able to practice and demonstrate various skills that I have learned so far.

First, I was able to create a repository on Github, then using the command line, I cloned the repository and created files and directories direclty from the terminal. After opening VSCode, I opened my html documents. Using recipes I found online, I add pictures to some of my documents and linked those to my homepage. Within each html document, I also included headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Finally, I pushed my new files to my Github repository. 

I did run into a few issues during this process but they were all quickly fixed and mostly due to typos but I believe the more I learn to code the less common these mistakes will be become.
